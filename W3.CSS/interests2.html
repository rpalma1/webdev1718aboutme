<h3> From the moment you get that driver’s license, you’ll never be the same again. You can go places. You break the bonds of being a dependent to actually being able to just bounce, on a whim, whenever you like. You are free to move about the country at your own pace. Getting the keys for the first time is your official rite of passage into adulthood.
Personality/Status
The wheels you choose are a direct extension of how you view yourself as a person. You should have a car that reflects traits of your personality. For the bold and adventurous, maybe you define yourself with a Subaru Outback. For those concerned about the environment, perhaps a Toyota Prius shows the world who you are.
Bonding
Cars are one of the greatest environments for bonding with family and friends. If you’re forming a new relationship, there are dozens of features and details about your car that can be used as conversation fodder. Long trips in a car with a new friend can also be the perfect tool to get to know someone fast and there are endless opportunities to get glimpses into the genuine personality of your new special friend. </h3>
